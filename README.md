Temperature Conversion Webpage
Overview
Welcome to the Temperature Conversion Webpage repository! This project was developed as a part of my internship to showcase my skills in web development and JavaScript programming. The webpage provides a simple and user-friendly interface for converting temperatures between Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit scales.

Features
Easy Conversion: The webpage offers a straightforward way to convert temperatures between three popular temperature scales: Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit.

Interactive Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily input temperatures and get accurate conversions.

Real-time Updates: As users input temperatures in one scale, the corresponding values in the other two scales are instantly updated, providing a seamless and dynamic user experience.

Clear Results: The converted temperatures are presented in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that users can quickly understand and make use of the converted values.

Technologies Used
HTML: The webpage structure and layout are built using HTML to create a well-organized and responsive design.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets are used to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage and ensure a consistent and attractive presentation.

JavaScript: The conversion logic is implemented using JavaScript, making the webpage interactive and enabling real-time updates of the converted temperatures.

Usage
Input: Enter the temperature value in the input field, accompanied by the corresponding temperature scale (Celsius, Kelvin, or Fahrenheit).

Conversion: As you enter the value, the webpage will automatically update the converted values in the other two scales in real time.

Result: The converted temperatures will be displayed below the input fields, providing you with immediate and accurate results.
